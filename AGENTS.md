# Development Rules

- Never `find /nix/store` or anything equivalent. Prefer using
  `nix flake archive --json`.
- Do not execute `nix flake archive --json` with commands that actually search
  over the result of that, as it forces the user to review every single time.
  Run `nix flake archive --json` once, then refer to its output literally in
  other, separate find commands. Not like `NIXPKGS=... rg $NIXPKGS`,
  _literally_, without any variables.
- Never use non-new `nix` commands. Prefer `nix build` over `nix-build` and so
  on. Always prefer new (nix3) commands.

# Nix Style Rules

- Prefer `lib.lists.singleton` over a single item list.
- Always `let inherit (lib.<path>) foo;` with full paths like `lib.lists.head`,
  never `inherit (lib) foo` unless `foo` has no submodule path.
- Always use the Dendritic Pattern (flake-parts `*.mod.nix` auto-discovery).
- Always prefer `${getExe pkgs.something}` over bare command names in shell
  aliases. Use `package = getExe pkgs.something` when there are multiple usages.
- Never put values in `let` bindings that duplicate module system options. If a
  value is set through `config.*`, always reference it through `config.*`. `let`
  bindings for hardcoded values that could be overridden via the module system
  are forbidden. `let` is fine for computed derivations, helper functions, and
  `getExe` shortcuts.
- Prefer destructuring attrset arguments when it improves clarity. Use
  `{ home, ... }:` instead of `value: value.home` where it makes sense.
- On Linux, use KDE applications (except Plasma). Dolphin over Thunar, Ark over
  xfce archive tools, etc.
- Prefer setting individual options with `mkIf` over wrapping entire attrsets.
  Use `foo.bar = mkIf condition value;` not
  `foo = mkIf condition { bar = value; };` when possible.
- Inline package definitions should use `pkgs.callPackage` with destructured
  args, e.g. `pkgs.callPackage ({ stdenv, writeText }: ...) { }`.
- For inline source code in packages, use `writeText` directly in the `src`
  attribute rather than a separate `let` binding.
- If a package is its own concern (e.g. a custom C tool), put the `perSystem`
  definition in its own `.mod.nix` file separate from the module that uses it.
- Prefer `<|` (pipe-last) over parentheses when the parenthesized expression is
  the final argument to a function. E.g. `mkIf condition <| toJSON { ... }`
  instead of `mkIf condition (toJSON { ... })`. Does not apply when the
  parenthesized expression is not the last argument (e.g.
  `callPackage (...) { }`). Does not work with `if`, `let`, or lambda
  expressions on the RHS — those still need parentheses.
- Do not use `builtins.` in modules.
- Never use `rec` ever. Worst case, define a custom `fix`.
